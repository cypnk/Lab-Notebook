# Lab Notebook
Printable laboratory notebook.

The exported PDF [lab sheets](https://github.com/cypnk/Lab-Notebook/raw/master/LabNotebook-sheets.pdf) and [table of contents sheets](https://github.com/cypnk/Lab-Notebook/raw/master/LabNotebook-contents.pdf) ready to be printed, as well as the original LibreOffice spreadsheets for custom changes are provided for convenience.

The lab sheets are numbered up to 200. If you need fewer pages than this, select the print range from 1-20 or 1-30 etc... up to the number of sheets you need. If you need more than the provided 200 sheets, simply copy > paste the page grid into a neighboring cell of the spreadsheet, keeping the page numbers in the same order. The table of contents sheets are numbered with Roman numerals up to 10.

The page numbers alternate on the upper corners of each sheet on both the labs and table of contents so remember to collate appropriately when printing. Do a test print of a few pages before doing a full run.

The font used is Liberation Mono. If you don't have this font, you can [download it free](https://github.com/liberationfonts).

The spreadsheet is hereby released into the [public domain](https://github.com/cypnk/Lab-Notebook/blob/master/LICENSE). You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
